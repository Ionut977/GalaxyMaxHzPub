# Galaxy Max Hz Premium Features

* Keep High/Adaptive motion smoothness when power saving mode is enabled whether manually or by the system/adaptive power saving.***  
Note: May not work on some devices which are updated to OneUI4.\*.  Test first.

 * Enable Adaptive Refresh Rate Mod for devices supporting multiple refresh rates but do not have the stock Adaptive motion smoothness (e.g. S20 series, S20FE, S21FE, A5, A7,   TabS7/S7+) with the ability to set the brightness threshold for its activation***

 * Quick-doze mod: Quickly enter doze mode during screen-off that can not be interrupted by motion ***

 * Override minimum refresh rate for adaptive mode to lower one (if available on the device)***

 * Resolution switcher filter: Filter what screen resolutions to include for the resolution switcher QS tile.

 * Auto SENSORS OFF (experimental non-root workaround):
   Device sensors will automatically turn off while screen is off until the device is unlocked. This helps minimize battery-draining motion-triggered wakelocks while device is not being used.

 * Statusbar net speed indicator
